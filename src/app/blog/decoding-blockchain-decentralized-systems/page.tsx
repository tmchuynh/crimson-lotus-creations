            <strong>Blockchain technology</strong> is revolutionizing industries
            by offering secure, decentralized systems that go beyond traditional
            data storage and transaction methods. From cryptocurrency to supply
            chain management, the applications of blockchain are vast and
            ever-expanding. In this blog, we’ll break down what blockchain is,
            how it works, and its potential to reshape our digital landscape.

            What is Blockchain?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            At its core, blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT)
            that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and
            transparent way. Unlike traditional databases, blockchain operates
            on a decentralized network, meaning no single entity controls the
            system. Each transaction is recorded in a "block," and these blocks
            are linked together in a chronological "chain."

            Key Features of Blockchain Technology
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Decentralization:</strong> Instead of relying on a central
              authority, blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network where
              every participant has access to the same data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> Transactions on a blockchain are
              visible to all participants, fostering trust and accountability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain uses advanced cryptography
              to secure data, making it nearly impossible to alter information
              once it’s been added to the chain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Immutability:</strong> Once a block is added to the
              blockchain, it cannot be changed, ensuring a reliable and
              tamper-proof record.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Many blockchains support
              programmable agreements called smart contracts, which
              automatically execute terms when predefined conditions are met.
            </li>
          </ul>

            How Blockchain Works
          </h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Transaction Initiation:</strong> A user initiates a
              transaction, such as transferring cryptocurrency or updating a
              supply chain record.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Validation:</strong> The transaction is validated by nodes
              (computers) in the network using consensus mechanisms like Proof
              of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Block Creation:</strong> Validated transactions are
              grouped into a block.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Block Addition:</strong> The block is added to the
              blockchain, creating a permanent, immutable record.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Completion:</strong> The transaction is confirmed, and the
              updated blockchain is shared across all nodes in the network.
            </li>
          </ol>
