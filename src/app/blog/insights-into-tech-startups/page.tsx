            What Defines a Tech Startup?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            A tech startup is a young company that leverages technology to solve
            problems or create new opportunities. Unlike traditional businesses,
            startups aim for rapid growth and scalability, often operating in
            sectors like software development, AI, FinTech, and IoT. Their
            ability to innovate quickly and adapt to market demands sets them
            apart.

            The Journey of a Tech Startup
          </h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Idea Generation:</strong> Startups begin with identifying
              a problem or gap in the market. Founders brainstorm innovative
              solutions and validate their ideas through research and feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP):</strong> An MVP
              is a simplified version of the product, built to test the core
              concept with early adopters and gather valuable insights for
              improvement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Securing Funding:</strong> Funding is crucial for scaling
              operations. Startups often rely on sources like venture capital,
              angel investors, crowdfunding, or bootstrapping to finance their
              growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scaling Operations:</strong> Once the product-market fit
              is achieved, startups focus on scaling by expanding their team,
              refining processes, and reaching a broader audience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Navigating Challenges:</strong> Startups face obstacles
              like competition, limited resources, and market volatility.
