            JavaScript frameworks have been at the heart of modern web
            development, enabling developers to build faster, more efficient,
            and highly interactive applications. As technology evolves, so do
            the frameworks that power the web, with emerging trends shaping the
            future of frontend and backend development. With frameworks like
            React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte continuously innovating, the focus
            is shifting towards performance optimization, server-side rendering
            (SSR), and developer-friendly tooling. Meta-frameworks like Next.js
            and Nuxt.js are also gaining popularity, offering better SEO,
            scalability, and improved user experiences. Looking ahead, we can
            expect lighter, faster, and more modular frameworks that emphasize
            static site generation (SSG), edge computing, and AI-powered
            development tools. As JavaScript frameworks continue to evolve,
            developers must stay adaptable and embrace new advancements to build
            the next generation of dynamic, scalable web applications.
